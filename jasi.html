    <h1>OBJECTIVES</h1>
</center>
<p>BTECH COMPUTER SCIENCE STUDENT AT NEHRU INSTITUE OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY. My passion for helping others has been evident in my involvement in Kalamazoo Public Schools and as a camp counselor for the last three years. Through those experiences I have learned to interact with a diverse group of people, which has increased my ability to relate to others. I have also had the opportunity to create lessons for the campers that focused on life skills like teamwork, communication, and time management. </p>
